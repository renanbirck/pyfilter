# pyfilter

Pyfilter is a Python tool for analog and digital filter synthesis. 
This was my final project for university and I decided to release as open source.

Dependencies:
* scipy
* matplotlib
* PyQt

To run: gui/gui_analog.py or gui/gui_digital.py

# TODO

1. Since this was done quite quickly, the code is a trainwreck: it needs to be made much more pythonic and OO.
2. Finish the implementations of the missing features.
3. A better UI.
